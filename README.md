# Home Control

A Home Automation framework designed for flexibility and reliability over usability

This is not a proper home automation system, this merely provides the tools needed to create such systems

My intention is to create a generic framework that I can use to create a system tailored to my home, I may extend this in the future or make it more generic, but for now that is the goal of this project

To note on usability: usability is certainly a great feature for any piece of software to strive for and I 
do strive for it here. However it can come with costs, this project prioritises usability lower than other
aspect whenever they come into conflict
